# Hangman

Hangman is a game I have created in python using GUI libraries like tkinter and Turtle.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Turtle.

```bash
pip install turtle

## How to play

Firstly choose a theme from the window.
Then Guess a letter that you think will be in the word that is associated with the chosen theme.
 A turtle screen will show the updates on the hangman.
Guess the word before the man gets Hanged!
